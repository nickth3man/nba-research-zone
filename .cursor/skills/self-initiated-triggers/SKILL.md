# Self-Initiated Triggers - From External Prompts to Internal Motivation

Self-Initiated Triggers (Internal Triggers) are emotional states or situations
that prompt users to engage with a product without any external reminder. They
represent the goal state of habit formation - when users think of your product
automatically in response to specific feelings or contexts.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing for long-term retention
- Reducing dependency on push notifications
- Building sustainable engagement loops
- Understanding user motivation patterns
- Creating products that become "default" solutions
- Reducing user acquisition costs through organic return

## Core Concepts

### External vs. Internal Triggers

```
External Triggers              Internal Triggers
(Pushed to user)               (Pulled by user)
      |                              |
      v                              v
+-------------+               +-------------+
| - Push      |               | - Boredom   |
|   notif     |   Journey     | - Anxiety   |
| - Email     | ----------->  | - FOMO      |
| - Ads       |               | - Loneliness|
| - WOM       |               | - Curiosity |
+-------------+               +-------------+
      |                              |
      v                              v
   Expensive                     Free
   Interruptive                  Seamless
   Declining effect              Strengthening
```

### The Trigger-Product Association

```
Emotion/Situation          Product Association
       |                          |
       v                          v
   "I feel bored"    -->    "I'll check Instagram"
   "I have a question" -->  "I'll Google it"
   "I feel anxious"   -->   "I'll check Slack"
   "I'm waiting"      -->   "I'll open TikTok"
```

### Trigger Types

| Trigger         | Emotion                             | Example Products              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Negative**    | Boredom, anxiety, loneliness, FOMO  | Social media, news, messaging |
| **Positive**    | Curiosity, excitement, anticipation | Learning apps, games          |
| **Situational** | Waiting, commuting, winding down    | Podcasts, reading apps        |
| **Routine**     | Morning, mealtime, bedtime          | News, meditation, fitness     |

### Building Internal Triggers

```
Phase 1: External Trigger
   "We sent you a notification"
              |
              v
Phase 2: Association Forming
   Repeated: Trigger → Action → Reward
              |
              v
Phase 3: Internal Trigger Emerging
   Emotion alone triggers action
              |
              v
Phase 4: Automatic Habit
   No conscious thought needed
```

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Identify Target Emotions

Research questions:

- What emotional state precedes product use?
- What are users feeling when they reach for the product?
- What situation or context triggers engagement?

| User Segment | Primary Emotion | Secondary Emotion | Context      |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| [Segment 1]  | [Emotion]       | [Emotion]         | [When/Where] |
| [Segment 2]  | [Emotion]       | [Emotion]         | [When/Where] |

### Step 2: Map Current Trigger Mix

```
External Triggers          Internal Triggers
[_____________________]    [_____________________]
        80%                         20%

Target state:
[_____________________]    [_____________________]
        30%                         70%
```

### Step 3: Design Trigger Strengthening

| Strategy                 | Implementation                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Repeated pairing**     | Consistent context → action → reward |
| **Emotional resonance**  | Design for target emotion            |
| **Ritual creation**      | Encourage routine usage              |
| **Social reinforcement** | Others validate the behavior         |

### Step 4: Measure Trigger Strength

| Metric                           | Weak Trigger | Strong Trigger |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Return frequency without prompts | Low          | High           |
| Time to return after absence     | Long         | Short          |
| Usage without notifications      | Rare         | Common         |
| Self-reported "automatic" use    | Never        | Often          |

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Twitter/X

**Target emotion**: Boredom + need for stimulation **Association built**: "I
have a spare moment → I'll check Twitter"

**Mechanisms**:

- Variable reward (always new content)
- Quick dopamine hits
- FOMO reinforcement
- Endless scroll removes end point

### Example 2: Slack

**Target emotion**: Anxiety about missing information **Association built**: "I
feel out of the loop → I'll check Slack"

**Mechanisms**:

- @mentions create urgency
- Channel activity visible
- "Unread" counts create incompleteness
- Professional FOMO

### Example 3: Duolingo

**Target emotion**: Guilt + achievement desire **Association built**: "I should
be productive → I'll do a lesson"

**Mechanisms**:

- Streak creates obligation
- Short lessons fit spare moments
- Progress visualization rewards
- Guilt as internal trigger (healthy or not)

## Ethical Considerations

### Healthy vs. Unhealthy Triggers

| Aspect                | Healthy                  | Unhealthy                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Emotion exploited** | Curiosity, growth desire | Anxiety, loneliness, FOMO |
| **User outcome**      | Feels better after use   | Feels worse or unchanged  |
| **Sustainability**    | Long-term satisfaction   | Short-term with regret    |
| **Control**           | User feels in control    | User feels compelled      |

### Design for Wellbeing

- Target positive emotions where possible
- Ensure product delivers on emotional promise
- Provide usage awareness tools
- Allow notification customization
- Design satisfying end points

## Best Practices

### Do

- Research actual emotional triggers (don't assume)
- Design reward to match the emotional need
- Create consistent context-action pairings
- Make first action extremely simple
- Measure self-initiated engagement separately

### Avoid

- Relying solely on external triggers long-term
- Exploiting negative emotions irresponsibly
- Breaking user trust with manipulative patterns
- Ignoring the emotional aftermath of use
- Designing without usage boundaries

## Integration with Other Methods

| Method                  | Combined Use                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Hooked Model**        | Internal triggers are the goal state |
| **Fogg Behavior Model** | Trigger is the T in B=MAT            |
| **Jobs-to-be-Done**     | Emotional jobs are internal triggers |
| **Loss Aversion**       | Fear of loss as internal trigger     |
