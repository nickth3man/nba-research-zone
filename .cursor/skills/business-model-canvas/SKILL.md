## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Define Customer Segments First

Start with who you serve:

```
Primary Segment:
├── Demographics: [Age, location, income]
├── Psychographics: [Values, interests, lifestyle]
├── Behaviors: [Usage patterns, buying habits]
└── Needs: [Jobs to be done, pains, gains]

Secondary Segments:
├── [Segment 2]
└── [Segment 3]
```

### Step 2: Articulate Value Proposition

For each segment, define the value:

```
Value Proposition Canvas:

Customer Jobs          Product/Service
├── Functional         ├── Features
├── Social             ├── Benefits
└── Emotional          └── Experience
        ↓                    ↓
Customer Pains     →   Pain Relievers
        ↓                    ↓
Customer Gains     →   Gain Creators
```

### Step 3: Map Channels and Relationships

How you reach and interact with customers:

```
Customer Journey:

Discover → Research → Buy → Use → Advocate
    │          │        │     │        │
    ▼          ▼        ▼     ▼        ▼
Channel:   SEO/Ads   Website  App   Email   Referral
Relation:  Automated  Self    Self  Auto    Community
```

### Step 4: Define Infrastructure

What you need to deliver:

```
Value Delivery Infrastructure:

Key Partners          Key Activities         Key Resources
├── Suppliers         ├── Core operations    ├── Physical
├── Distributors      ├── Support            ├── Intellectual
└── Allies            └── Platform           ├── Human
                                             └── Financial
```

### Step 5: Model Economics

Understand the financial viability:

```
Revenue Streams                 Cost Structure
├── [Stream 1]: $X/unit        ├── Fixed: $Y/month
├── [Stream 2]: $X/month       ├── Variable: $Z/unit
└── [Stream 3]: X% of GMV      └── CAC: $W/customer

Unit Economics:
├── LTV: $[amount]
├── CAC: $[amount]
├── LTV:CAC ratio: [X]:1
└── Payback period: [months]
```

## Output Template

After completing analysis, document as:

```markdown

## Best Practices

### Do

- **Start with customer** - Everything flows from customer segments
- **Test assumptions** - Each block contains hypotheses to validate
- **Iterate frequently** - Update as you learn from the market
- **Check coherence** - All blocks should connect logically
- **Quantify where possible** - Add numbers to revenue and costs

### Avoid

- **Inside-out thinking** - Don't start with product features
- **Static canvas** - It's a living document, not a one-time exercise
- **Ignoring competition** - Understand competitor business models
- **Skipping validation** - Assumptions need testing with real customers
- **Over-complicating** - Keep it high-level and actionable
