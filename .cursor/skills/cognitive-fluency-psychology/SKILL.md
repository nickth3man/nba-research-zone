# Cognitive Fluency - Psychology of Ease

Cognitive fluency is the ease with which our brains process information. When
something feels simple and easy to understand, our minds interpret that
simplicity as a signal that it must be true, safe, or worth engaging with.
Clarity always beats cleverness.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing landing pages and marketing content
- Writing UI copy and microcopy
- Evaluating brand names and messaging
- Auditing content for readability
- Optimizing conversion funnels
- Creating training materials and documentation

## Core Principle

```
Processing Fluency Impact:

Easy to process           →  Feels familiar
        ↓                           ↓
Feels trustworthy         →  Feels valuable
        ↓                           ↓
Higher engagement         →  Better conversion

The brain's rule: "If it's easy, it must be good."
```

## Key Research Findings

### Truth and Repetition

| Finding                                      | Implication                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Repeated statements feel more true           | Use consistent messaging across touchpoints |
| Simple fonts increase perceived truthfulness | Choose clarity over creativity in key areas |
| High contrast increases credibility          | Prioritize readability over aesthetics      |
| Familiar words feel more accurate            | Use everyday language, not jargon           |

### Task Perception Studies

```
Font Impact on Task Perception:

Simple, clear font:
├── Estimated task time: 8 minutes
├── Perceived difficulty: Low
└── Likelihood to start: High

Complex, decorative font:
├── Estimated task time: 15+ minutes
├── Perceived difficulty: High
└── Likelihood to start: Low

Same instructions, different perception.
```

### Cognitive Effort Discounting (COGED)

The brain reduces subjective value when tasks require more mental effort:

- Processing difficulty = perceived "cost"
- People avoid cognitive load instinctively
- Fluent experiences create positive emotions
- Effort required transfers to value judgment

## Fluency Audit Framework

### Step 1: Identify High-Stakes Content

Map where fluency matters most:

```
Priority Content:
├── Headlines and value propositions (Critical)
├── CTAs and conversion points (Critical)
├── Onboarding instructions (High)
├── Pricing and plans (High)
├── Error messages (Medium)
└── Help documentation (Medium)
```

### Step 2: Apply the 5-Second Test

For each critical element:

1. Show to someone unfamiliar with your product
2. Give them exactly 5 seconds to read
3. Ask them to explain:
   - What is this?
   - Who is it for?
   - What should I do next?
4. If they struggle → rewrite for fluency

### Step 3: Check Fluency Factors

| Factor               | Check                           | Fix                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Typography**       | Is font ≥16px for body?         | Increase size        |
| **Contrast**         | Is ratio ≥4.5:1?                | Improve contrast     |
| **Sentence length**  | Are sentences <20 words?        | Split long sentences |
| **Word choice**      | Would a 12-year-old understand? | Simplify vocabulary  |
| **Visual hierarchy** | Is main point obvious?          | Strengthen hierarchy |
| **White space**      | Is content breathing?           | Add spacing          |

### Step 4: Test and Measure

| Metric          | What it Shows           |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Time on page    | Processing difficulty   |
| Scroll depth    | Engagement with content |
| Bounce rate     | Initial fluency failure |
| Conversion rate | End-to-end fluency      |
| Task completion | Instruction clarity     |

## Common Fluency Killers

### Design Problems

```
❌ Fluency Killers:

Typography:
├── Poor contrast ratios
├── Tiny or decorative fonts
├── Inconsistent sizing
└── ALL CAPS for long text

Layout:
├── Cluttered composition
├── Competing visual elements
├── No clear focal point
└── Walls of text
```

### Content Problems

```
❌ Content Fluency Killers:

Language:
├── Industry jargon
├── Complex sentences
├── Passive voice overuse
└── Unclear pronouns

Structure:
├── Too many concepts at once
├── Buried key information
├── Missing headings/breaks
└── No logical flow
```

## Output Template

After completing audit, document as:

```markdown
## Cognitive Fluency Audit

**Page/Content:** [Name]

**Date:** [Date]

### 5-Second Test Results

| Tester | What is it? | Who for?   | Next action? | Pass? |

## Real-World Applications

### Landing Pages

```
Before (low fluency):
"Leverage our cutting-edge, AI-powered solution to
optimize your workflow efficiency and drive ROI."

After (high fluency):
"Get more done in less time with AI that actually works."

Changes:
├── Removed jargon (leverage, cutting-edge, optimize)
├── Shortened sentence (13 words → 10 words)
├── Made benefit concrete (workflow efficiency → more done)
└── Added relatability (actually works)
```

### Brand Names

Research shows companies with easy-to-pronounce names:

- Perform better after IPOs
- Are remembered more often
- Get recommended more frequently
- Build trust faster

```
High Fluency Names:    Low Fluency Names:
├── Apple              ├── Xobni
├── Google             ├── Qwikster
├── Slack              ├── Tronc
└── Zoom               └── Quibi
```

### Product Interfaces

```
Fluent Interface Patterns:

Forms:
├── One question per screen (not multi-field)
├── Smart defaults pre-filled
├── Inline validation (not page-level)
└── Progress indicator visible

Navigation:
├── Familiar patterns (hamburger, tabs)
├── Maximum 5-7 top-level items
├── Clear current location indicator
└── Predictable behavior
```
